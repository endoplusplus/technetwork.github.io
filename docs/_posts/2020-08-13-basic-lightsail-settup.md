## Use AWS Lightsail to get started 
The option to start the cloud computing power is using Amazon Lightsail. As Nijim, S says “Lightsail is an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers you everything needed to build an application or website, plus a cost-effective, monthly plan.”

### 1. Create aws account [here](/assets/basic-lightsail-settup/https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) (a credit/debit card is required, you are charged what you use) Or [here](/assets/basic-lightsail-settup/https://aws.amazon.com/)
<br />

### 2. Once in the aws console, look for **Lightsail** Service, and click on it.
